    "# Regression with Linear Algebra - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll apply regression analysis using simple matrix manipulations to fit a model to given data, and then predict new values for previously unseen data. You'll follow the approach highlighted in previous lesson where you used Numpy to build the appropriate matrices and vectors and solve for the $\\beta$ (unknown variables) vector. The beta vector will be used with test data to make new predictions. You'll also evaluate the model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make this experiment interesting, you'll use NumPy at every single stage of this experiment i.e. loading data, creating matrices, performing test train split, model fitting and evaluations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use linear algebra to apply simple regression modeling in Python and NumPy only\n",
    "* Apply train/test split using permutations in NumPy\n",
    "* Use matrix algebra with inverses and dot products to calculate the beta\n",
    "* Make predictions from the fitted model using previously unseen input features \n",
    "* Evaluate the fitted model by calculating the error between real and predicted values\n",

    "## Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you'll use for this experiment is \"**Sales Prices in the City of Windsor, Canada**\", something very similar to the Boston Housing dataset. This dataset contains a number of input (independent) variables, including area, number of bedrooms/bathrooms, facilities(AC/garage) etc. and an output (dependent) variable, **price**.  You'll formulate a linear algebra problem to find linear mappings from input to out features using the equation provided in the previous lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow you to find a relationship between house features and house price for the given data, allowing you to find unknown prices for houses, given the input features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A description of dataset and included features is available [here](https://rdrr.io/cran/Ecdat/man/Housing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In your repository, the dataset is available as `windsor_housing.csv` containing following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "there are 11 input features (first 11 columns):\n",
    "\n",
    "\tlotsize\tbedrooms  bathrms  stories\tdriveway  recroom\tfullbase  gashw\t airco  garagepl   prefarea\n",
    "\n",
    "and 1 output feature i.e. **price** (12th column). \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this lab is not really answering a preset analytical question, but to learn how you can perform a regression experiment, similar to one you performed in statsmodels, using mathematical manipulations. So you won't be using any Pandas or statsmodels goodness here. The key objectives here are to \n",
    "- understand regression with matrix algebra, and \n",
    "- mastery in NumPy scientific computation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stage 1: Prepare Data for Modeling \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's give you a head start by importing the dataset.You'll perform following steps to get the data ready for analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initialize an empty list `data` for loading data\n",
    "* Read the csv file containing complete (raw) `windsor_housing.csv`. [Use `csv.reader()` for loading data.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html). Store this in `data` one row at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Drop the first row of csv file as it contains the names of variables (header) which won't be used during analysis (keeping this will cause errors as it contains text values).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Append a column of all 1s to the data (bias) as the first column\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convert `data` to a Numpy array and inspect first few rows \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: `read.csv()` reads the csv as a text file, so you should convert the contents to float."
